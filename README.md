Purpose:
The purpose of the Code Profile AI project is to develop an innovative solution that leverages artificial intelligence to analyze code provided by businesses. This solution will enable organizations to efficiently determine the specific cloud resources required to run their code effectively, thus optimizing costs and enhancing operational efficiency.

By integrating with Amazon S3 for code storage and utilizing AWS services such as Lambda and EMR for execution, Code Profile AI aims to automate the resource allocation process. Our goal is to provide a seamless user experience where businesses can upload their code and receive accurate resource specifications, tailored to the unique requirements of their applications.

Objectives:

To build an intuitive web interface that allows users to upload code directly from Amazon S3.
To develop an AI model that analyzes the uploaded code and predicts the necessary computational and storage resources.
To ensure that the solution is scalable, reliable, and capable of supporting various programming languages and execution environments.
To deliver actionable insights and visual representations of resource requirements, empowering businesses to make informed decisions regarding their cloud resource utilization.
By achieving these objectives, Code Profile AI aims to become a trusted partner for businesses seeking to streamline their cloud operations and maximize the efficiency of their software deployments.
